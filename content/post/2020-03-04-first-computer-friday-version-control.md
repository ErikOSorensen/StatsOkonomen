Friday March 6 we'll have the first Computer Friday meeting -- in FAIR-1. The topic of the day
will be **version control**, in particular the subversion system that Choice Lab researchers
have been using since 2007. 

In addition to providing an overview of how subversion works, I'll try to provide
a comparison to "Git", which might be a more popular system today (but also more complex). 
I'll also show how one particular piece of FAIR infrastructure, our joint bibliography database "mmbib",
is available as a subversion "repository". 

All participants will get a personal subversion repository, and explanations for how to establish
collaborative repositories to hold research project content.


# Before the meeting
If you want to join the practice session, you need to have a subversion client installed
on your computer. If you have a windows computer, the client you want is most likely 
[Tortoise SVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/). If you don't have administrative rights, 
you probably need to ask IT services for help installing it. 
If you have a mac there are many choices -- a fully
graphical interface is [Versions](https://versionsapp.com/), but it is also possible to use
a terminal client (Ceren might be the one with the most experience on this).
