Last updated: 2023-04-17 (added '\*'s to readings). 

The course is divided into two parts. The first part concern philosophy of science and scientific-internal questions, the second part discusses scientific practice from external perspectives: Historical, ethical, political, sustainability, and the sociology of scientific practice.

The aim is that students should know and discuss the most common arguments made on the knowledge-theoretical grounding of scientific practice in economics and related fields such as finance and management science.

# Lectures

Starting spring 2023, MET528 will be given in weekly lectures. 
We will meet in **Auditorium F**, every **Tuesday morning** throughout the
semester, from 0815 to 1000. First day of lecturing is January 10, last day is April 18.
There is no lecture March 28 or April 4.

# Evaluation

There is a mandatory term paper with deadline by the end of the lectures. Supervision
will be available for the choice of topic and method to approach it. Students
are expected to present their topic to the class at an early stage. For course approval,
(1) active participation in class, (2) the presentation of term paper topic and (3) 
an acceptable term paper is required.

The deadline of the term paper is **May 2**.
There will also be a written exam (**June 12**) to 
test understanding of the written material. 

# Readings

There are two required books:

- Samir Okasha  (2016).  *Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction.* Second Edition, Oxford University Press.
- Nancy Cartwright and Eleonora Montuschi eds. (2014). *Philosophy of Social Science: A New Introduction.* Oxford University Press.

These books have been ordered to Akademika and should be available for ordering
through the department admin if you want to use your department funding. 
All of the book by Okasha is mandatory, much of Cartwright and Montuschi will also
be mandatory. 

There will also be a number of papers to read that will be made available later.


# Lecture plan

Note that the reading marked with an "\*" will be considered particularly
important when it comes to testing on the written exam. All listed readings are
relevant, and for the evaluation of your term paper, whether there is an '\*'
