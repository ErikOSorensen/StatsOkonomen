As of 2022-12-06. To be expanded.

The course is divided into two parts. The first part concern philosophy of science and scientific-internal questions, the second part discusses scientific practice from external perspectives: Historical, ethical, political, sustainable, and the sociology of scientific practice.

The aim is that students should know and discuss the most common arguments made on the knowledge-theoretical grounding of scientific practice in economics and related fields such as finance and management science.


# Lectures

Starting spring 2023, the MET528 will be given in weekly lectures. 

We will meet in **Auditorium F**, every **Tuesday morning** throughout the
semester, from 0815 to 1000. First day of lecturing is January 10, last day is April 18.
There is no lecture April 4.

# Evaluation

There is a mandatory term paper with deadline by the end of the lectures. Supervision
will be available for the choice of topic and method to approach it. Students
are expected to present their topic to the class at an early stage. For course approval,
(1) active participation in class, (2) the presentation of term paper topic and (3) 
an acceptable term paper is required.

There will also be a written exam (tentatively in the week June 12-16) to 
test understanding of the written material.
