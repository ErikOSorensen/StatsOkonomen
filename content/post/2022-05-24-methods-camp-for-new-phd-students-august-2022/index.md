Methods Camp is a two-week intensive course to get all incoming PhD students
in economics to ensure that everyone are familiar with some technical
tools before the main courses start. There are two week-long and separate parts: The first
deals with general mathematical tools: Calculus, Analysis, and Linear Algebra. The second part
is more specific and deals with with probability and statistics. 

Participation in the Methods Camp is voluntary, but all SAM economics students are expected
to sit a 3 hour exam immediately after the camp in order to evaluate if some further
tutoring is necessary.  

If you plan to take part in this course, please [fill out this brief survey](https://forms.gle/vkbV96xXr8i8d1j3A) such
that we know a bit about how many students there will be and something about your background. Looking forward
to see you in August!


# Math part 

- Instructor: Justin Valasek
- email: <justin.valasek@nhh.no>
- office: D222
- lectures: Week 33 (Aug 15--19), two daily sessions. 

## Outline
For some of you this will be a review (again, the course is not mandatory), and
some of you will be seeing this material for the first time. My main goal with
the class is to make everyone comfortable with: (1) the basic mathematical tools
we use in economic theory, and (2) constructing simple proofs. I am assuming
everyone is familiar with basic calculus (derivatives and integrals), and this course
will focus on giving you "deeper" conceptual insight into math.

**Textbook**: The main textbook is Carl P. Simon and Lawrence Blume, 
"Mathematics for Economists", Norton 1994. However, this book is more of a reference
than a pedagogical text, so I will also be providing handouts and notes. Again, if
something is new to you, the best way to learn is by doing problems!

Some other standard textbooks in Mathematical Economics: Alpha C. Chiang,
"Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics", McGraw Hill, 1983. Walter
Rudin, "Principles of Mathematical Analysis", McGraw Hill. A. MasCollel, M.D.
Whinston, and J.R. Green, "Microeconomic Theory" (math appendix). A more 
advanced books: Rakesh V. Vohra, "Advanced mathematical economics", Routledge,
2005. A.N. Kolmogorov, "Introductory Real Analysis", Courier Dover 
Publications, 1975. A more dense, dictionary like book: Knut Sydsæter, Arne Strøm,
Peter Berck, "Economists’ Mathematical Manual", Springer 1999.

## List of topics

# Probability and Statistics

- Instructor: Erik Ø. Sørensen
- email: <erik.sorensen@nhh.no>
- office E228
- lectures: Week 34 (Aug 22--26), two daily sessions.

## Outline
The plan is to go through all of the basics of probability and statistics - not to introduce
topics that are unfamiliar to most new PhD students, but introduce a bit more of the
formal notation than new students traditionally have been familiar with. 

**Textbook**: A very compact book that covers everything is Oliver Linton's [Probability, Statistics and Econometrics](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-Econometrics-Oliver-Linton-dp-0128104953/dp/0128104953/). A few additional readings will be made available. 

## List of topics:

1. Probability on sets 
    - probability spaces
    - Conditional probability and Bayes' law
2. Random variables in one dimension
    - distributions
    - Expectations, including moment generating functions
    - Transformations
3. Random vectors
    - Generalizations to more dimensions (for the general case, mostly two dimensions)
    - Independence and random n-samples.
4. Estimation
    - The analog principle
    - Method of moments
    - Maximum likelihood
5. Asymptotics
    - Convergence in probability and distribution
    - A central limit theorem
    - The delta-rule
6. Inference 
    - Null hypothesis testing
    - Statistical power
    - Some statistical properties of common statistical practices
