Python is one of the most popular general purpose programming languages. 
It is also one of the most popular languages for "data science" in both business 
and academia. It can be used for everything from simple house-holding tasks to 
symbolic and numerical maths. The modern standard for programming interactive 
experiments, o-Tree, is also a Python framework. 
At FAIR, Python is used for implementing experiments, estimating 
models, brute force solving of symbolic math problems, keeping track of administrative actions, 
and for everyday minor automation.

At FAIR we believe that everyone should have some exposure
and experience with a general purpose programming language, it is not necessary to be an expert
at programming (or in a particular programming language) to be useful.
The idea of the workshop is to be together in way that is sufficiently intense for everyone to get
started and practice writing a bit of Python using their own computer; we want to encourage 
everyone to think about automating boring tasks, and develop their own skills. No prior experience
with Python is necessary, if you have experience writing do-files or R-scripts, you should be 
sufficently prepared! 

The philosophy of the workshop is to start with basic Python constructs and explore what we can
do with even very basic Python. Often there will be very elaborate libraries available that can solve
tasks very efficiently, but getting to know these libraries can feel overwhelming. We start from
scratch, and then only later will indicate how adopting efficient libraries can speed up both
the writing and the execution of programs.

It is difficult to fit a full one-day workshop into the schedule at FAIR, and instead the plan is
to split the workshop over two consecutive days. 

There will also be a pre-workshop session to help everyone get Python and necessary tools installed
on their computer such that it is possible to actively follow the workshop.


1. **Introduction**. Thursday 2023-03-23 at 0900-1100 in FAIR-1. Getting started with Python, basic syntax. Motivating example: How to get Python to solve general nonlinear equations of one variable.
2. **Input and output**. Thursday 2023-03-23 at 1330-1530 in FAIR-1. How to read and write data from disk. Running example: How to read data from an experiment, match participants, draw payments and write payment file to disk.
3. **Building simple data structures**. Friday 2023-03-24 at 0900-1100 in FAIR-1. Building larger structures depend on breaking things
down (more smaller pieces) but also bundling different pieces of data together (fewer but larger pieces). Running example: How to bundle numbers
into vectors and matrices for simple linear algebra operations.
4. **What are "libraries" and how are they useful**. Friday 2023-03-24 at 1330-1530 in FAIR-1. Looking at the examples from sessions 1-3, is it possible
to rely on the work of experts such that we can write more succinct and efficient code? Yes! We'll look at some of the popular libraries that would
have been very useful for solving the example tasks from the workshop.
