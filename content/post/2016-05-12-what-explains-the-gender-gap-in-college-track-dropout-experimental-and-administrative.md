Sammen med kollegaer har jeg et notat i årets utgave av **American Economic Review (Papers and Proceedings)**, om "[What Explains the Gender Gap in College Track Dropout? Experimental and Administrative Evidence](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20161075)". Med Ingvild Almås, Alexander W. Cappelen, Kjell G. Salvanes og Bertil Tungodden.

## Sammendrag: 
> We exploit a unique data set, combining rich experimental data with
> high-quality administrative data, to study dropout from the college track in
> Norway, and why boys are more likely to drop out. The paper provides three main
> findings. First, we show that family background and personal characteristics
> contribute to explain dropout. Second, we show that the gender difference in
> dropout rates appears both when the adolescents select into the college track
> and after they have started. Third, we show that different processes guide the
> choices of the boys and the girls of whether to drop out from the college track.
