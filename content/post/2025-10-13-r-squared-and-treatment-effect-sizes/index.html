<p>I wrote this for my another purpose, and thought that I might as well make it public.</p>
<p>For a treatment-control contrast, let’s examine the regression
model
<span class="math display">\[ y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \epsilon_i,\]</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(var(\epsilon_i)=\sigma^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> being a 0/1 indicator variable
for treatment (1) vs control (0). Assume that the proportion of
treated units is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Now, since the OLS estimate is consistent (randomization), the limit of <span class="math inline">\(R^2=var(\widehat{y})/var(y)\)</span> can be calculated to be
<span class="math display">\[ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}R^2 = \frac{\beta^2 p(1-p)}{\beta^2 p(1-p) + \sigma^2}.\]</span>
Expressing the treatment effect in standardized form (Glass <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>),
we can write <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=\beta/\sigma\)</span>, and then we have
<span class="math display">\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}R^2  = \frac{\Delta^2 p(1-p)}{\Delta^2 p(1-p) + 1}.\]</span>
If we also assume that the treatment and control arms are equally large (<span class="math inline">\(p=1/2\)</span>, which gives us the largest
possible <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> given the treatment effect), we get <span class="math inline">\(p(1-p)=1/4\)</span> and<br />
<span class="math display">\[ \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}R^2 = \frac{\Delta^2}{\Delta^2 + 4}.\]</span></p>
<p>We can draw this for different values of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>:</p>

<p>We see that even for treatment effect sizes that are quite respectable, the amount
of explained variance is quite limited. For a <span class="math inline">\(0.2\sigma\)</span> effect, <span class="math inline">\(R^2\approx 0.01\)</span>.</p>
