I am a professor of Economics at 
NHH Norwegian School of Economics.

I trained as a labour economist, specializing in human capital accumulation. Lately, I have been using experiments to work on models of social preferences and on how to adapt stochastic choice models to such models. I have a strong interest in developing software infrastructure for supporting research in economics.
